The '''Scottish Premier League''' ('''SPL''') is the [[Scottish football league system|top level]] league competition for professional [[Association football|football]] clubs in [[Scotland]]. The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL).

{{As of|2011|10}} the Scottish Premier League is ranked 17th in the [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA rankings]] of European leagues, which are based on the performances of member clubs in European competitions.<ref>{{cite web | title=UEFA Country Ranking 2011  | url= http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/index.html | publisher=Bert Kassies| work=UEFA European Cup Football Results and Qualification|date= 17 May 2011 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> A total of [[List of Scottish Premier League clubs|19 clubs]] have competed in the SPL since its inauguration in [[1998–99 Scottish Premier League|1998–99]] but only two, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], have won the title.

== Background ==

Previously, the [[Scottish Football League]] had a two divisional structure (Divisions One and Two) between which clubs were [[promotion and relegation|promoted and relegated]] at the end of each season. However, by the mid 1970s, this organisation was perceived to be stagnant, and it was decided to split into a three divisional structure: [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] (formerly Division One), [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] (formerly Division Two) and a newly added [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This system came into force for the [[1975–76 in Scottish football|1975–76 season]]. This setup continued until the [[1994–95 in Scottish football|1994–95 season]], when a four divisional structure was introduced, along with a new [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]], with all four divisions consisting of ten clubs.

On 8 September 1997, the football clubs in the Premier Division decided to split from the Scottish Football League and form the Scottish Premier League, following [[Premier League#Foundation|an earlier example in England]], which came into force during the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]]. This decision was fuelled by a desire by the top clubs in Scotland to retain more of the revenue generated by the game. Originally, league sponsorship money was divided proportionally between clubs in all four divisions. After the SPL was formed, its clubs retained all of its commercial revenues except for an annual payment to the SFL and a parachute payment to relegated clubs.

== Competition format ==
[[Image:Edinburgh Derby 2006.jpg|thumb|Hearts take on Hibernian in an [[Edinburgh Derby]] played at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]] in December 2006]]

There are currently twelve clubs in the Scottish Premier League. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner.

A season, which runs from July until May, is divided into two phases. During the first phase, each club plays three games against every other team, either once at home and twice away or vice-versa. After this first phase of matches, by which time all clubs will have played 33 games, the league splits into a 'top six'  and a 'bottom six'. Each club then plays a further five matches against the other five teams in their own section. Points achieved during the first phase of 33 matches are carried forward to the second phase, but the teams will compete only within their own sections during the second phase. After the first phase has been completed, clubs cannot move out of their own section in the league, even if they achieve more or fewer points than a higher or lower ranked team, respectively.

At the beginning of each season, the Scottish Premier League 'predicts' the likely positions of each club in order to produce a fixture schedule that will ensure the best possible chance of all clubs playing each other twice at home and twice away. These are known as the league seeding and are based on clubs' performance in previous years.<ref name="SPL stand by their split decision">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_19990808/ai_n13940102/pg_1|work=[[Sunday Herald]]|title=SPL stand by their split decision|date=8 August 1999|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> However, should a club not finish in the half where it was predicted to finish, it faces the possibility of playing an unequal number of home and away games; for example, one club may play another three times at home and once away.<ref name="SPL stand by their split decision"/>

The bottom placed SPL club at the end of the season is relegated, and swaps places with the winner of the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]], provided that the winner satisfies the league's entry criteria.

=== Split ===

Originally the SPL contained 10 clubs, but it subsequently enlarged to 12 for the [[2000–01 in Scottish football|2000–01 season]] onwards. The increase from 10 clubs to 12 was part of the deal offered to obtain approval from SFL member clubs. Since then, the SPL has operated a "split league format" to prevent the need for a 44-game schedule, which was once used in the Scottish Premier Division, but is now considered to be too high a number of games in a league season.

Under this system, after 33 games (i.e., when every club has played every other club three times, either twice away and once at home or vice-versa) the division is split into two halves. The clubs play a further five matches against the teams in their half of the division, taking their total to 38 games. This can (and often does) result in the team placed seventh having a higher points total than the team placed sixth, because their final five games are considerably easier. For example, in the [[Scottish Premier League 2005–06|2005–06 season]], the seventh placed club, [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]], gained more points than the fourth placed club, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]].

There has been criticism of the split season format. In April 2007, [[Craig Levein]] labelled it as "rubbish" and a "nonsense", claiming that it resulted in lost revenue for clubs and put more pressure on managers,<ref name="Levein SPL Split">{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-161704189.html |work=Daily Mail |location=UK|title=The SPL split makes no sense, insists Levein SPL split is a nonsense, insists Craig|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> while Rangers manager [[Walter Smith]] branded the format as "unfair" and called for an 18-team league to be considered.<ref name="Smith SPL Split">{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-162408933.html |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |title=Smith in blast at SPL split decision|date=21 April 2007|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> The SPL has defended the split format, however, and dismissed the possibility of expanding the league due to a lack of strong enough clubs within the [[Scottish Football League]].<ref name="SPL stand by their split decision"/> In March 2008 Kilmarnock manager [[Jim Jefferies]] was the latest to call for a league revamp, claiming that the potential for four matches per season against the same opponent is too many.<ref name="Jefferies league revamp">{{cite news|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/scottishpremier/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/08/03/20/SOCCER_Kilmarnock_Nightlead.html&TEAMHD=scotspremiership|publisher=[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]|title=

=== Promotion and relegation ===

Providing they meet certain criteria regarding their stadium, the top club from the Scottish First Division is promoted to the SPL, with the 12th-placed SPL club relegated. These promotion criteria have previously caused controversy. In 2003, the chairmen of the member clubs voted against [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]]'s proposed ground share with [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] and stopped the club from having the 10,000 capacity stadium it required, thus saving [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] from relegation.<ref name="Falkirk lose out as SPL closes ranks and denies them place">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/spl/Falkirk-lose-out-as-SPL.2430042.jp|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|title=Falkirk lose out as SPL closes ranks and denies them place|author=Jonathan Coates|date=24 May 2003|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref>

The same situation nearly materialised in 2004. After several votes and discussion, including threats of court cases from [[Partick Thistle]], the team threatened with relegation, [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] were promoted on the basis that they would ground share with [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]].<ref name="Inverness win SPL vote">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/3828873.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Inverness win SPL vote|date=22 June 2004|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> In 2005, the stadium size criterion for entry to the SPL was reduced to 6,000,<ref name="Inverness are homeward bound">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/inverness_ct/4076125.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Inverness are homeward bound|date=7 June 2004|accessdate=25 March 2008}}</ref> thereby allowing Inverness Caledonian Thistle to return to their home stadium during the [[Scottish Premier League 2005–06|2005–06 season]].<ref name="Inverness are homeward bound"/>

=== Old Firm dominance ===
[[Image:Oldfirm.jpg|thumb|Both sets of fans at an [[Old Firm]] match at [[Celtic Park]]]]

One of the main criticisms of the SPL was the dominance of the two [[Old Firm]] clubs, Celtic and Rangers. No team outside the Old Firm has won the SPL since it was formed in 1998 and there has only been one season ([[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06]]) where both clubs failed to occupy first and second positions, with [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] finishing second behind Celtic.<ref name = "low in att">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/top-football-stories/low-in-attendance-low-in-achievement-the-spl-s-dismal-legacy-of-failure-1-2409692|title=Low in attendance, low in achievement  – the SPL’s dismal legacy of failure|work=sport.scotsman.com|publisher=Johnston Press|first=Ewing|last=Grahame|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> Whilst this is similar to other European leagues, this dates back to the beginning of Scottish league football, with a few exceptional periods. The average home attendances of both clubs was significantly higher than the other 10 clubs, which resulted in the Old Firm having far greater revenues and therefore more money to spend on players. Both clubs also received significant revenue from their regular participation in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]].

Despite having more resources than other Scottish clubs, the Old Firm experienced difficulty in competing with big clubs from other leagues in terms of transfer fees and player wages due to the SPL's relatively low television revenue. A recurring theme in recent years has been the prospect of the two clubs leaving the Scottish football set-up to join either the [[English football league system|English set-up]], or an [[Atlantic League (football)|Atlantic League]] with clubs from countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal.<ref name="Dutch resurrect Atlantic League">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/1947226.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Dutch resurrect Atlantic League|date=24 April 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> While some feel that the departure of the Old Firm from the Scottish football setup would be detrimental to Scottish football as a whole,<ref name="Blatter opposes Old Firm switch">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/7284560.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Blatter opposes Old Firm switch|date=7 March 2008|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref><ref name="Old Firm urged to talk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1983550.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Old Firm urged to talk|date=12 May 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> others, such as [[Craig Levein]], believe it would benefit Scottish football due to increased competition among the remaining clubs for the SPL title.<ref name="Levein wants Old Firm kicked out">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/heart_of_midlothian/1916159.stm|publisher=BBC |work=BBC Sport  |title=Levein wants Old Firm kicked out|date=7 April 2002|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> World football's governing body [[FIFA]] has ruled out the prospect of any move to the English set-up.<ref name="Fifa writes off Old Firm hopes">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1465004.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=Fifa writes off Old Firm hopes|date=30 July 2001|accessdate=26 March 2008}}</ref> The duopoly was effectively broken when Rangers entered insolvency in 2012 and were liquidated.

=== Winter break ===

A further issue of controversy was the SPL's decision to scrap the 'winter break' after the [[Scottish Premier League 2000–01|2000–01 season]], thereby forcing clubs to play throughout January and often resulting in postponement of matches and significant damage to clubs' pitches due to adverse weather conditions, as well as player fatigue  {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.

=== European qualification ===
[[Image:Barcelona vs Rangers 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rangers playing [[FC Barcelona]] at the [[Camp Nou]] in the [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08 Champions League]]]]

The Scottish Premier League were thirteenth in [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA's coefficient]] ranking for 2009, meaning that for the 2010–11 season, two SPL clubs qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] (the SPL champions, who entered the group stages since the defending champions had already qualified to the group stages, and the runners-up, who entered the third qualifying round for non-champions) as well as two qualifying for the [[UEFA Cup|UEFA Europa League]] (the third and fourth placed clubs). The winners of the [[Scottish Cup]] also qualify for the Europa League, unless that team have already qualified for either the Champions League or Europa League. If the Scottish Cup winners have already qualified for the Champions League, the Europa League place is handed to the runners-up, and if the winners have already qualified for the Europa League, the Europa League place is given to the highest-placed SPL club who have not qualified for European competition. The same rule also applies if both the winners and the runners-up have already qualified. In 2010, as [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] had qualified for the Europa League through both winning the Scottish Cup and finishing third in the SPL, a Europa League place passed to [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], who finished fifth in the SPL.

Clubs also had the opportunity to apply for qualification to the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] before it was folded into the Europa League; qualification for that event was given to the highest placed applicant, although only two clubs chose to play in the tournament since the SPL's inception in 1998–99 ([[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in [[2001 UEFA Intertoto Cup|2001]] and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in [[2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup|2004]], [[2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup|2006]] and [[2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup|2008]]). Clubs may also qualify for Europe via the [[UEFA Fair Play ranking]].

Since the SPL's inception, Scotland's UEFA co-efficient has improved significantly, having been ranked 26th in 1998–99.<ref name="SPL praises Euro performances">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/7259596.stm|publisher=BBC Sport  |title=SPL praises Euro performances|date=22 March 2008|accessdate=22 March 2008}}</ref> In 2003 Celtic became the first Scottish club since [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in 1987 to reach a European final, eventually losing 3–2 to [[F.C.

Until 1995, the winners of the [[Scottish League Cup]] were granted a place in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], although this privilege was rarely invoked as the winning teams usually qualified for Europe by some other means such as winning the League Championship or Scottish Cup. The most recent example was [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], who represented Scotland in the [[1995–96 UEFA Cup]] after winning the League Cup the previous season as a [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] club.<ref>{{cite news

 | title =  Rovers dream of Euro return
 | publisher =   BBC Sport
 | date =   9 April 2010
 | accessdate = 10 May 2012}}</ref>  This privilege has since been discontinued due to the reduction in the number of European places granted to Scottish clubs.

== Players ==

Scottish Premier League clubs have almost complete freedom to sign whatever number and category of players they wish. There is no team or individual salary cap, no squad size limit, no age restrictions other than those applied by general employment law, no restrictions on the overall number of foreign players, and few restrictions on individual foreign players – all players with EU nationality, including those able to claim an EU passport through a parent or grandparent, are eligible to play, and top players from outside the EU are able to obtain UK work permits.

The only restriction on selection is the "Under-21 rule". This rule states that each club must include at least three players under the age of 21 in its matchday squad. Opinions on this rule appear to be divided among SPL managers. [[Walter Smith]], [[Gus MacPherson]] and [[Jim Jefferies]] have expressed their disapproval of the policy.<ref name="Under-21 ruling">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/08/17/sfnsco117.xml |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |title=SPL face fresh criticism over under-21 rule|date=17 August 2007|accessdate=22 March 2008 | first=Jamie | last=Murdoch }}</ref> [[John Collins (footballer born 1968)|John Collins]], meanwhile, expressed approval of the ruling, claiming that it is healthy for Scottish football and encouraged the development of young players.<ref name="Under-21 ruling"/>

Recent decline in television revenue has resulted in relatively little spending among SPL clubs in recent seasons, with major transfer spending mostly limited to the Old Firm clubs. As a result, many clubs are now more reliant on developing their own young players and selling them on for profit. This has also resulted in a large proportion of SPL clubs' squads being made up of Scottish players (73% in the [[2004–05 Scottish Premier League|2004–05 season]]).<ref name="SPL FAQ">{{cite news|url=http://www.scotprem.premiumtv.co.uk/page/SPLFAQs/0,,10002,00.html|publisher=Scottish Premier League|title=FAQs|accessdate=22 March 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

=== Attendances ===
Due to its relatively low income from television and commercial partners, Scottish clubs are highly dependent on revenues from fans attending matches. More people in [[Scotland]] per head of population watch their domestic top-level league than any other European nation.<ref>{{cite news

=== Top scorers ===

Former [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] player [[Kris Boyd]] has scored the most goals in the SPL, with 164 goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotprem.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Records/0,,10002,00.html |title=Scottish Premier League &#124; Scottish Football Results & News |publisher=Scotprem.premiumtv.co.uk |date=30 December 2009 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref> He broke the previous record of 158, set by [[Henrik Larsson]], by scoring five goals for Rangers in a 7–1 win against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 30 December 2009. Boyd and Larsson are the only players to have scored more than 100 goals in the SPL, which started in the [[1998–99 in Scottish football|inaugural 1998–99 season]]. There are players who have scored far more goals in the predecessor [[Scottish Football League]] competition, with [[Jimmy McGrory]] and [[Bob McPhail]] each scoring more than 300 goals in the top flight of Scottish football.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scottops-allt.html Scotland – All-Time Topscorers], [[RSSSF]].</ref>
