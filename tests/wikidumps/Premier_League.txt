The '''Premier League''' is an English professional league for association football clubs. At the top of the [[English football league system]], it is the country's primary football competition. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with [[the Football League]]. The Premier League is a corporation in which the 20 member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to May, with teams playing 38 matches each, totalling 380 matches in the season. Most games are played in the afternoons of Saturdays and Sundays, the other games during weekday evenings. It is currently [[English football sponsorship|sponsored]] by [[Barclays|Barclays Bank]] and thus officially known as the '''Barclays Premier League'''. Outside England it is commonly referred to as the '''English Premier League''' (EPL).

The competition formed as the '''FA Premier League''' on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the [[Football League First Division]] to break away from The Football League, which was originally founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights deal.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://worldsport.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/16/which-football-league-is-the-worlds-best/ |title=United (versus Liverpool) Nations |newspaper=The Observer |date=6 January 2002 |accessdate =8 August 2006}}</ref> This deal will be worth £3&nbsp;billion as of 2013–14, with [[BSkyB]] and [[BT Group]] securing the rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively.<ref>{{cite news |title=Premier League lands £bn deal |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/13/premier-league-tv-rights-3-billion-sky-bt/ |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 June 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2012 }}</ref> The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643&nbsp;million homes.<ref>{{cite news |title=The World's Most Watched League |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/about/the-worlds-most-watched-league.html |work=Premier League |publisher=PremierLeague.com |date=16 November 2011 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> In the [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11 season]] the average Premier League match attendance was 35,363, the second highest of any professional football league other than the German [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]],<ref>{{cite web|title=German Bundesliga Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ger.1/year/2010/german-bundesliga?cc=4716}}</ref> and stadium occupancy was 92.2% capacity.<ref>[http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/about/history.html History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Premier League ranked first in the [[UEFA coefficient|Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) coefficient]]s of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the last five years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kassiesa/bert/uefa/data/method4/crank2011.html |title=UEFA ranking of European leagues |last=Kassies |first=Bert |publisher=Bert Kassies |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=13 November 2010 }}</ref>

Since 1888, a total of 23 clubs have been crowned [[list of English football champions|champions of the English football system]].

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Despite significant European success during the 1970s and early 1980s, the late '80s had marked a low point for English football. [[Stadium|Stadia]] were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]] was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/31/newsid_2481000/2481723.stm |title=1985: English teams banned after Heysel |work=BBC Archive |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 August 2006 |date=31 May 1985}}</ref> The [[Football League First Division]], which had been the top level of English football since 1888, was well behind leagues such as Italy's [[Serie A]] and Spain's [[La Liga]] in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.<ref name="premsitehistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/History/0,,12306,00.html |title=A History of The Premier League |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 November 2007}}</ref> However, by the turn of the 1990s the downward trend was starting to reverse; England had been successful in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], reaching the semi-finals. [[UEFA]], European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990 (resulting in Manchester United lifting the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1991) and the [[Taylor Report]] on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadia in the aftermath of the [[Hillsborough disaster]], was published in January of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/communityfootball/violence_taylor_report.asp |title=The Taylor Report |publisher=Football Network |accessdate=22 November 2007}}</ref>

Television money had also become much more important; the Football League received £6.3&nbsp;million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but when that deal was renewed in 1988, the price rose to £44&nbsp;million over four years.<ref name="leicester_tv">{{cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/sociology/css/resources/factsheets/fs8.html |title=Fact Sheet 8: British Football on Television |publisher=Centre for the Sociology of Sport, University of Leicester |last=Crawford |first=Gerry |accessdate=10 August 2006}}</ref> The 1988 negotiations were the first signs of a breakaway league; ten clubs threatened to leave and form a "super league", but were eventually persuaded to stay.<ref name="FLhistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html |title=The History of the Football League |publisher=Football League |accessdate=12 September 2010 |archivedate=11 April 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080411034859/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10794,00.html |deadurl=yes}}</ref> As stadia improved and match attendance and revenues rose, the country's top teams again considered leaving the Football League in order to capitalise on the growing influx of money being pumped into the sport.<ref name="FLhistory"/>

At the close of the 1991 season, a proposal for the establishment of a new league was tabled that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |title=In the matter of an agreement between the Football Association Premier League Limited and the Football Association Limited and the Football League Limited and their respective member clubs |work=HM Courts Service |publisher=HM Government |year=2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927222536/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from [[The Football Association]] and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/History/0,,12306,00.html |title=A history of the Premier League |publisher=Premier League|accessdate=4 January 2008}}</ref>

In 1992 the First Division clubs resigned from the Football League ''[[en masse]]'' and on 27 May 1992 the FA Premier League was formed as a [[private limited company by shares|limited company]] working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in [[Lancaster Gate]].<ref name="premsitehistory"/> This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.<ref name="FLhistory"/>

The league held its first season in [[1992–93 FA Premier League|1992–93]] and was originally composed of 22 clubs. The first ever Premier League goal was scored by [[Brian Deane]] of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--the-premier-kickoff-fergusons-false-start-1540915.html |title=The Premier Kick-Off: Ferguson's false start |first=Phil |last=Shaw |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 August 1992 |accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref> The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], and [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=1&seasonid=122 |title=Final 1992/1993 English Premier Table |work=Soccerbase |publisher=Racing Post |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] were the three teams relegated from the old first division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.

=== Development ===
{{See also|List of Premier League seasons}}
Due to insistence by the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA), the international governing body of football, that domestic leagues reduce the number of games clubs played, the number of clubs was reduced to 20 in 1995 when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted. On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fifa wants 18-team Premier League |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5061302.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 }}</ref> Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.

== Corporate structure ==
The Premier League is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a [[shareholder]], with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2861&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who%20We%20Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |title=Our relationship with the clubs |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=8 August 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061114102011/http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2861&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who+We+Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |archivedate=14 November 2006 }}</ref> The current chairman is [[Dave Richards|Sir Dave Richards]], who was appointed in April 1999, and the chief executive is [[Richard Scudamore]], appointed in November 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/10/premierleague. englandfootballteam1|title=Premier League v England time-line|first=Sachin|last=Nakrani|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The former chairman and chief executive, [[John Quinton (banker)|John Quinton]] and [[Peter Leaver]], were forced to resign in March 1999 after awarding consultancy contracts to former Sky executives [[Sam Chisholm]] and [[David Chance]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/feb/25/broadcasting3|title=Timeline: a history of TV football rights|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 February 2003|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2851&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who%20We%20Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |archivedate=18 March 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060318214006/http://www.premierleague.com/fapl.rac?command=setSelectedId&nextPage=enSimpleStories&id=2851&type=com.fapl.website.stories.SimpleStories&categoryCode=Who+We+Are&breadcrumb=about_breadcrumb |deadurl=yes |title=The Premier League and Other Football Bodies |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref>

The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's [[European Club Association]], the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to [[UEFA coefficients]]. For the 2010–11 season the Premier League had 10 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecaeurope.com/Default.aspx?id=1082680 |title=ECA Members |publisher=European Club Association |accessdate=7 September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecaeurope.com/Default.aspx?id=1085058 |title=European Club Association: General Presentation |publisher=European Club Association |accessdate=7 September 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100809132539/http://www.ecaeurope.com/Default.aspx?id=1085058 <!-- Added by H3llBot --> |archivedate=9 August 2010}}</ref>

== Competition format ==
=== Competition ===
There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin system]]), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sporting-life.com/football/live/tables/premiership.html |title=Barclays Premier League |work=Sporting Life |publisher=365 Media Group |accessdate=26 November 2007}}</ref> The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the [[Football League Championship]], and the top two teams from the Championship, together with the winner of [[Football League Championship play-offs|play-offs]] involving the third to sixth placed Championship clubs, are promoted in their place.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=294727 |title=Huge Stakes For Championship Play-Off Contenders |work=Goal |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=26 November 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071203202007/http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=294727 <!-- Added by H3llBot --> |archivedate=3 December 2007}}</ref>

==== Qualification for European competitions ====
[[File:Arsenal vs Borussia Dortmund.jpg|thumb|[[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]] in 2011]]
As of the 2009–10 season qualification for the UEFA Champions League changed, the top four teams in the Premier League qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]], with the top three teams directly entering the group stage. Previously only the top two teams qualified automatically. The fourth-placed team enters the Champions League at the play-off round for non-champions and must win a [[two-legged tie|two-legged knockout tie]] in order to enter the group stage.<ref>{{cite news |title=UEFA Executive Committee approves changes to UEFA club competitions |url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/630630.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=UEFA |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=15 August 2008}}</ref> The team placed fifth in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the [[UEFA Europa League]], and the sixth and seventh-placed teams can also qualify, depending on the winners and runners-up of the two domestic cup competitions. Two Europa League places are reserved for the winner of each of the domestic cup competitions; if the winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the Champions League, then that place will go to the runner-up, and if the runner-up is also already qualified, then that place will go to the next-best placed finisher in the Premier League. If the winner of the League Cup has already qualified, that place goes to the next-best placed team in the league.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA Europa League |url=http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/competitions/Regulations/01/62/69/60/1626960_DOWNLOAD.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/fans/faqs/who-qualifies-to-play-in-europe/ |publisher=Premier League |title=Who qualifies to play in Europe? |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> A further place in the UEFA Europa League is also available via the [[UEFA Fair Play ranking|Fair Play initiative]]. If the Premier League has one of the three highest Fair Play rankings in Europe, the highest ranked team in the Premier League Fair Play standings which has not already qualified for Europe will automatically qualify for the UEFA Europa League first qualifying round.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=8/newsid=795065.html |title=Norway lead Respect Fair Play league |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010 |publisher=UEFA}}</ref>

An [[Liverpool F.C. 2005–06 UEFA Champions League qualification|exception to the usual European qualification system]] happened in 2005, after [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/4613695.stm |title=Liverpool get in Champions League |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 June 2005 |accessdate=11 December 2007}}</ref> UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=698237.html?cid=rssfeed&att=index |title=EXCO approves new coefficient system |publisher=UEFA |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |archivedate=21 May 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080521053931/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=698237.html?cid=rssfeed&att=index |deadurl=yes}}</ref> This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League the previous year, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.{{fact|date=August 2012}}

In 2007, the Premier League became the highest ranking European League based on the performances of English teams in European competitions over a five-year period. This broke the eight-year dominance of the Spanish league, [[La Liga]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~kassiesa/bert/uefa/data/index.html#part3 |title=UEFA European Cup Coefficients Database |last=Kassies |first=Bert |publisher=Bert Kassies |year=2010 |accessdate=9 September 2010 }}</ref> The top three leagues in Europe are currently allowed to enter four teams into the Champions League. [[Michel Platini]], the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the top three leagues and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/11/13/sfnuef113.xml |title=Clubs force UEFA's Michel Platini into climbdown |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=13 November 2007 |accessdate=2 December 2007 |first=David |last=Bond}}</ref> In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top four leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7090646.stm |title=Platini's Euro Cup plan rejected |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=11 December 2007 }}</ref>

The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers [[Garrard & Co|Asprey of London]]. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a [[malachite]] plinth base. The plinth weighs 33&nbsp;lbs (15&nbsp;kg) and the trophy weighs 22&nbsp;lbs (10&nbsp;kg).<ref>{{Cite news |title=Size and weight of the Barclays Premier League trophy |url=http://premierleague.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28/~/size-and-weight-of-the-barclays-premier-league-trophy |work=Premier League |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref> The trophy and plinth are {{convert|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|43|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name="Trophy">{{cite web |url=http://premierskills.britishcouncil.org/premier-league/the-premier-league-trophy |title=The Premier League Trophy |accessdate=11 September 2010 |work=Premier Skills|publisher=British Council}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Its main body is solid [[sterling silver]] and silver [[gilding|gilt]], while its plinth is made of malachite, a [[semi-precious]] stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. Malachite's green colour is also representative of the green field of play.<ref name="Trophy"/> The design of the trophy is based on the [[heraldry]] of [[Royal Arms of England|Three Lions]] that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sponsorship.barclays.co.uk/football/trophy-tour-fact.html |title=What makes the Barclays Premier League Trophy so special? |publisher=Barclays |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title [[The Invincibles (football)|without a single defeat]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/51204716/Getty-Images-Sport |title=Arsenal v Middlesbrough |date=22 August 2004 |publisher=Getty Images |accessdate=7 September 2010}}</ref>

Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The money from television rights has been vital in helping to create excellence both on and off the field. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to [[BSkyB]] in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.<ref name="leicester_tv"/>

The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8545202.stm|title=Why TV is the key to Real success|first=Nils|last=Blythe|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=2 March 2010|accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The money is divided into three parts:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.premierleague.com/page/Faqs/0,,12306,00.html |title=Frequently asked questions about the F.A.

The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/premier-league-nets-16314bn-tv-rights-bonanza-1925462.html |title=Premier League nets £1.4bn TV rights bonanza |newspaper=The Independent |last=Harris |first=Nick |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref>

The league brought in £320&nbsp;million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/160604/premier-league-launches-international-rights-tender |title=Premier League launches international rights tender |work=SportBusiness |publisher=SBG Companies Ltd. |accessdate=12 September 2010}}</ref> Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when [[Setanta Sports]] was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the [[European Commission]] that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7&nbsp;billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3&nbsp;pm match solely for Irish viewers. The [[BBC]] has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on ''[[Match of the Day]]'') for £171.6&nbsp;million, a 63&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent increase on the £105&nbsp;million it paid for the previous three-year period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/5060828.stm |title=BBC keeps Premiership highlights |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 June 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006}}</ref> [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] broadcast the [[Premier Soccer Saturday|highlights package]] in Ireland.

A major criticism of the Premier League has been the emergence of the so-called "Big Four" clubs (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/article3908394.ece |title=Breaking up the Premier League's Big Four |date=11 May 2008 |last=Northcroft |first=Jonathan |newspaper=The Sunday Times |accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref><ref name=Bestofrest>{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=405515&root=england&&cc=5739 |title=The best of the rest |date=29 January 2007 |work=Soccernet |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=27 November 2007}}</ref> With the exception of Blackburn Rovers in [[1994–95 FA Premier League|1994–95]] and Manchester City in [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12]], only three clubs have won the Premier League title – Manchester United (12 titles), Arsenal and Chelsea (three titles each). In addition, Manchester United have not finished outside the top three since the formation of the Premier League. With the top 4 places ensuring qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League]] in the summer of 2002 and ever since, and with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s new-found wealth after its purchase by [[Roman Abramovic]] in the summer of 2003, the concept of a "Big Four" came into being, as they dominated the top four spots, and thus places in the [[UEFA Champions League]], winning all but one of the top four places between 2003-04 and 2008-09, the only exception being [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s 5th place behind [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2004-05, though they still got into the Champions League for 2005-06 by winning it in 2004-05. (Qualification was one club for the first four seasons, increased to two clubs in 1997, three in 1999 and four since 2002). The benefits of qualification, especially increased revenue, are believed to have widened the gap between the "Big Four" clubs and the rest of the Premier League.<ref name=Bestofrest/> [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] are second with 17 top four finishes, followed by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] with 12 and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] with 11. The team who have appeared in the top four on the most occasions, and are not part of this "Big Four", is [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

In May 2008, then Newcastle United manager [[Kevin Keegan]] said the "Big Four"'s dominance threatened the division, stating: "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world."<ref>{{cite news |title=Power of top four concerns Keegan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7384247.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 May 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2008 }}</ref> Following Keegan's comments, Premier League chief executive [[Richard Scudamore]] defended the league, saying, "There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting."<ref>{{cite news |title=Scudamore defends 'boring' League |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7388360.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=7 May 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2008 }}</ref> The dominance of Chelsea and Manchester United has led some to believe that the "Big Four" has contracted to a "Big Two"; prior to 2012, no club other than these two had won the Premier League since [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2005]] and, {{as of|2012|05|lc=on}}, 21 of the last 28 major domestic trophies have gone to either [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] or [[Old Trafford]].<ref name=BBCbig4>{{cite news |title=Has the Premier League Big Four become a Big Two? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8888167.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=13 August 2010 |accessdate=13 August 2010 }}</ref>

The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the "Big Four" with two new clubs, [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], vying for top four places to secure Champions League football. In the [[2009–10 Premier League|2009–10 season]], Tottenham pipped Manchester City to finish fourth and become the first team to "break" the top four since Everton in 2005, with both Manchester City and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] also finishing above Liverpool, one of the "Big Four" teams. In [[2010–11 Premier League|2010–11]], Manchester City finished third – the first time a team has broken into the top three since Newcastle did so in the 2002–03 season. This has continued into the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12 season]], with Manchester City winning the title for the first time since [[1967–68 in English football|1968]], the first team outside the "Big Four" to do so since [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95]]. In addition, Chelsea finished outside the top four for the first time since [[2001–02 FA Premier League|2001–02]], as did Liverpool for the third season in a row. Criticism of the gap between an elite group of "super clubs" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alex McLeish says Aston Villa struggle to compete with top clubs |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14844717.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=8 September 2011 }}</ref>

=== Widening gap with lower leagues ===
{{See also|Premier League–Football League gulf}}
One of the main criticisms levelled at the Premier League is the increasing gulf between the Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the [[The Football League|Football League]], many established clubs in the Premier League have managed to distance themselves from their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing in large part to the disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues,<ref name="guardian">{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1771399,00.html |title=Rich clubs forced to give up a sliver of the TV pie |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=8 August 2006 |first=David |last=Conn |date=10 May 2006}}</ref> many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except [[2001–02 FA Premier League|2001–02]] ([[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]) and 2011–12 ([[Queens Park Rangers]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Norwich City]]), at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In [[1997–98 FA Premier League|1997–98]] all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news |title=1997/98 – Season Review |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=333233&root=extratime&cc=5739 |last=Brewin |first=John |date=4 July 2005 |accessdate=29 November 2007 |work=Soccernet |publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

The Premier League distributes a small portion of its television revenue to clubs that are relegated from the league in the form of "parachute payments". Starting with the [[2006–07 FA Premier League|2006–07]] season, these payments are in the amount of £6.5&nbsp;million over the club's first two seasons in lower leagues, although this rose to £11.2&nbsp;million per year for clubs relegated in 2007–2008.<ref name="guardian"/> Designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £45&nbsp;million while the average Football League Championship club receives £1&nbsp;million),<ref name="guardian"/> critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1837801,00.html |title=Why clubs may risk millions for riches at the end of the rainbow |date=5 August 2006 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=13 August 2006 |first=Stuart |last=James}}</ref> leading to the common occurrence of teams "[[Premier League–Football League gulf|bouncing back]]" soon after their relegation. For some clubs, including [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Coventry City F.C. |Coventry City]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League, financial problems, including in some cases [[Administration (British football)|administration]] or even liquidation have followed. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have ensued for several clubs unable to cope with the gap.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23664566-details/Premier+League+casualties+-+clubs+that+have+struggled+since+relegation/article.do |title=Premier League casualties – clubs that have struggled since relegation |newspaper=Evening Standard |publisher=Daily Mail & General Trust |first1=Ben |last1=Bailey |first2=Patrick |last2=Whyte |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=7 April 2009 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090322034918/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23664566-details/Premier+League+casualties+-+clubs+that+have+struggled+since+relegation/article.do <!-- Added by H3llBot --> |archivedate=22 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2299511/Down-again-Leicesters-relegation-horror.html |title=Down again: Leicester's relegation horror |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=7 April 2009}}</ref>

In response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young British players in favour of signing less-expensive foreign players, in 1999, the [[Home Office]] tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=32096&NewsAreaID=2 |title=New Work Permit Criteria for Football Players Announced |work=Department for Education and Employment |publisher=HM Government |date=2 July 1999 |accessdate=1 July 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930154815/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=32096&NewsAreaID=2 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> Currently a non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years.

There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League.

Players in the Premier League compete for the Premier League Golden Boot, awarded to the top scorer at the end of each season, as well as for Golden Boot awards for the first person to score 10, 20 or 30 goals in a season. They can also compete for the informal competitions of [[Goal of the Month (England)|Goal of the Month]] and [[Goal of the Season]]. Former Blackburn Rovers and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] [[striker]] [[Alan Shearer]] holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260. Shearer finished among the top ten goal scorers in 10 out of his 14 seasons in the Premier League and won the top scorer title three times.
