The '''Football League Championship''' (often referred to as the '''Championship''' for short, or the '''[[RWE npower|npower]] Championship''' for sponsorship reasons) is the highest division of [[The Football League]] and second-highest division overall in the [[English football league system]] after the [[Premier League]].

The Football League Championship was introduced for the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05 season]], having been previously known as the [[Football League First Division]]. According to [[Deloitte]], in the 2004–05 season it was the wealthiest non-top flight [[association football|football]] division in the world, and the sixth richest division in Europe.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5032978.stm First fall in Premiership wages], BBC News, 31 May 2006, reporting on Deloitte's review of football finance in 2004–05</ref>

The winners of the Football League Championship receive the Football League Championship trophy which is the same trophy as the old First Division (now the [[Premier League]]) Champions were handed prior to the Premier League's inception in the 1992–93 season. 

At present (2012/2013 season), [[Ipswich Town]] have held the longest tenure in the Championship, having not been promoted or relegated from the division since the 2002–03 season.

==History==
:''For history before 2004, see [[Football League First Division]] after 1993 and [[Football League Second Division]] before that year''
In [[2004–05 in English football]], the Football League Championship announced a total attendance (including postseason) of 9.8&nbsp;million, which it said was the fourth highest total attendance for a European football division, behind the FA Premier League (12.88[[1000000 (number)|m]]), Spain's [[La Liga|Primera división]] (11.57m) and Germany's [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] (10.92m), but beating Italy's [[Serie A]] (9.77m) and France's [[Ligue 1]] (8.17m).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4748403.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Countdown underway to new season | date=6 August 2005 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/newspaper/0,,174-1712938,00.html |work=The Times |location=UK| title=Championship glories in outstripping Serie A | first=Peter | last=Lansley | date=29 July 2005 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2005/08/Features_ChampionshipSuccess.htm First class second division]{{dead link|date=October 2010}} TheFA.com</ref> The total figures were aided somewhat by the presence of 24 clubs, compared to 20 clubs in both Serie A and Ligue 1, and 18 in the Bundesliga. A major factor to the competition's success comes from television revenue.

On 30 September 2009, [[Coca-Cola]] announced they would end their sponsorship deal with [[the Football League]] at the end of the [[2009–10 Football League|2009–10 season]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/sep/30/coca-cola-football-league-sponsorship Coca-Cola end Football League sponsorship deal] The Guardian, 30 September 2009</ref> On 16 March 2010, [[RWE npower|Npower]] were announced as the new title sponsors of the Football League, and from the start of the 2010–11 Football League season, the Football League Championship is known as the ''Npower Championship''.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8570749.stm Football League names Npower as new sponsor ] BBC Sport, 16 March 2010</ref>

==Structure of the league==
The league comprises 24 teams. Over the course of a season, which runs annually from August to the following May, each team plays twice against the others in the league, once at 'home' and once 'away', resulting in each team competing in 46 games in total. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a loss. The teams are ranked in the league table by points gained, then goal difference, then goals scored and then their head-to-head record for that season. In the event that two or more teams finish the season equal in all these respects, teams are separated by alphabetical order, unless a promotion, relegation or play-off place (see below) is at stake, when the teams are separated by a play-off game, though this improbable situation has never arisen in all the years the rule has existed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sporting-life.com/football/live/tables/cc_champ.html | title = Championship | publisher=Sporting Life | accessdate =2 April 2008}}</ref>

At the end of the season, the top two teams and the winner of the [[Football League Championship play-offs|Championship play-offs]] are promoted to the [[FBS Premier League|Premier League]] and the bottom three teams are relegated to [[Football League One]]. The Football League Championship play-offs is a knock-out competition for the teams finishing the season in third to sixth place with the winner being promoted to the Premier League. In the play-offs, the third-placed team plays against the sixth-placed team and the fourth-placed team plays against the fifth-placed team in two-legged semi-finals (home and away). The winners of each semi-final then compete in a single match with the prize being promotion to the Premier League and the Championship play-off trophy.

The three promoted teams are replaced in the division for the next season by the teams finishing in the bottom three in the Premier League and the relegated teams are replaced by the two teams finishing at the top of League One and the winner of the League One play-off final.

==Broadcasting rights==
===UK Television===
From 2009–2012 [[Sky Sports]] have the rights to broadcast 65 live matches, live coverage of both legs of both play off semi finals and the play off final live.<ref>[http://www.football-league.co.uk/staticFiles/2e/ae/0,,10794~110126,00.pdf Football League Agrees Historic Deal With Sky Sports and BBC] football-league.co.uk press release</ref> The [[BBC]] has the rights to show 10 first choice live games for the regular season as well as the rights to show a highlight show.
