The '''Scottish Football League Third Division''' is the lowest division of the [[Scottish Football League]] and the fourth overall in the [[Scottish football league system]].

The Third Division consists of ten teams with the champion being automatically promoted to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at the end of each season. The clubs that finish 2nd, 3rd and 4th enter a [[play-off]] with the 9th placed team of the Second Division.
 
There is no relegation from the Third Division.

The teams play each other four times with three points for a victory, one point for a draw and zero points for a loss.

== History ==
The Scottish Football League has introduced a third division on three occasions.

=== Original Third Division ===
An original Third Division was inaugurated in time for the [[1923&ndash;24 in Scottish football|1923&ndash;24 season]]. The Division was an actual third tier of the Scottish League, made up largely of provincial sides. The initial championship was won by {{fc|Arthurlie}}, who were promoted along with {{fc|East Stirlingshire}}. Although {{fc|Leith Athletic}} were admitted the following season many clubs in the division struggled financially  with {{fc|Dumbarton Harp}} resigning during [[1924&ndash;25 in Scottish football|1924&ndash;25]]. [[1925&ndash;26 in Scottish football|The following season]] was to be the last for this incarnation, with the competition left uncompleted as struggling teams failed to fulfil their fixtures. Of the members all but {{fc|Forfar Athletic}}, who were co-opted into the higher division, were reassigned to non-league football.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot3hist.html#24 Scotland - Final Tables Third Level 1924&ndash;2004]</ref>

=== 'C' Division ===
The third tier in the Scottish Football League returned for the [[1946&ndash;47 in Scottish football|1946&ndash;47 season]] when the 'C' Division was founded. In contrast to the earlier version the 'C' Division was a curious amalgamation of minor clubs and reserve teams: in its first season it was made up of the first teams of {{fc|Stirling Albion}} (promoted as champions), Leith Athletic (also promoted), East Stirlingshire, Forfar Athletic, {{fc|Montrose}}, {{fc|Brechin City}} and {{fc|Edinburgh City}}. The Division continued in this form for three seasons with a fairly fluid membership, although at the end of each season a non-reserve team was crowned champions and duly promoted. 

The competition was restructured for the [[1949&ndash;50 in Scottish football|1949&ndash;50 season]] when the number of reserve sides was significantly expanded and the Division divided into two sections, the South-East (soon renamed the North-East) and South-West. Promotion became rarer as the reserve sides of the bigger clubs such as {{fc|Rangers}} and {{fc|Aberdeen}} came to dominate; Brechin City's victory in the North-East section in the [[1953&ndash;54 in Scottish football|1953&ndash;54 season]] was the sole promotion achieved in the new format before its final season. The competition completed its final season in [[1954&ndash;55 in Scottish football|1954&ndash;55]] when Aberdeen II won the North-East section and Partick Thistle II the South-West. Three non-reserve sides, Montrose, East Stirlingshire and {{fc|Berwick Rangers}}, remained in the North-East section with two, {{fc|Dumbarton}} and {{fc|Stranraer}}, in the South-West. All five were admitted to full membership of the Scottish Football League.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot3hist.html#47 Scotland - Final Tables Third Level 1924&ndash;2004]</ref>

=== Current incarnation ===
From 1994 to 1998 the new Third Division was the fourth level in the [[Scottish Football League]], but became the third when the member teams of the Scottish Premier Division broke away to form the [[Scottish Premier League]].

Sky Sports and ESPN currently have the television rights for the league broadcasting 15 Rangers matches over the course of the season.

== Introduction of play-offs and relegation ==
The division contains ten teams and, until recently, each season the top two teams were promoted to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. As of the [[2005&ndash;06 in Scottish football|2005&ndash;06 season]], the 2nd, 3rd and 4th placed teams go into a play off with the 9th place team from the Second Division. There is no direct relegation from the Scottish Third Division but since the 2005&ndash;06 season if a club finishes bottom for three successive seasons then they will have their full membership of the SFL suspended. The club will then play the next two seasons as a non-voting associate member after which the full members shall vote on the fate of the suspended club.

== Sponsorship ==
On 20 July 2007, it was announced that the [[Scottish Football League]] would be sponsored by the makers of Scottish soft drink [[Irn-Bru]] for the next three seasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/6908169.stm|title=SFL ends search for new sponsor|date=2007-07-20|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=2008-09-23}}</ref> [[Irn-Bru]] extended their sponsorship of the SFL for another three seasons from 2010/2011 onwards.<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/8523226.stm "SFL secures sponsorship extension with Irn-Bru"] article from BBC Sport</ref>
